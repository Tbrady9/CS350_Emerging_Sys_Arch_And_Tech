**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving**
--

The first project that I chose was the morse code assignment from module 5. The goal of this assignment was to create a program that continuously looped an SOS morse code message blinking on the red and green LEDs. When a button is pushed, the SOS message should change to an 'OK' morse code message that is continuously looped.

The second project that I chose was the thermostat project from module 7. The goal of the project was to develop a program that mimicked the basic functionality of a thermostat. The Texas Instruments Microboard should read the room temperature, compare it to a set point temperature, and decide if the heat should turn on or not. There were to be two buttons (one to turn the set temperature up and another to turn it down). If the heat should be on, a red LED should indicate that on the microcontroller.

**What did you do particularly well?**
--

Each assignment had different pieces to it. There was usually a coding piece and a diagram piece. I feel I did a great job at planning out how I would try to solve the coding piece by doing the diagram first. This allowed me to break out the assignments into pieces and resulted in a much easier time coding. If the program changed during coding, it was usually extremely easy to go back and make changes to the diagram afterwards.

**Where could you improve?**
--

While I believe the organization and structure of the morse code assignment is great, I believe the same cannot be said about the thermostat project. There were a lot of additional pieces on this project so simplifying and structuring took something of a back seat to functionality. I plan to go back at a later date to clean that project up and simplify it.

**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**
--

The main tool that I am adding is a basic understanding of how embedded systems work. I believe this is huge because embedded systems are everywhere today and are continuing to expand their applications. This course has exposed me to a lot of topics and tools to which I had not been previously exposed. Code Compser Studio is one of them as I had never used this IDE before. A microcontroller was another. The header files for some of the includes proved to be invaluable in explaining what certain functions did. The documentation for the Texas Instruments Microcontroller that we were using for the entirety of the course was also extremely useful.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**
--

I look forward to working more with embedded systems. As stated previously, they are everywhere. I have no doubt that this course has prepared me well for the next step in that journey by establishing a solid base understanding. More generally, each class like this offers valuable experience in things like problem solving, debugging, and critical thinking. These are skills that can be used in any coding related class and most of it can be applied to other situations in life that have nothing to do with coding.

**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
--

As stated previously, my morse code project feels very structured and organized. It is well commented and simplified which makes it very easy to follow. People of varying experience levels will most likely be able to pick this project up and easily understand what it is doing to expand on it if necessary. My thermostat project could use some cleanup to get it to the same level.
